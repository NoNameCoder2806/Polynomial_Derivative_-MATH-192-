 --- A program to calculate the derivative based on the derivative order ---
1. A Polynomial class to store the whole polynomial function
    The member(s) are:
        - a character as the symbol of the function
        - a character as the symbol of the variable
        - a vector to store all the Terms
        - an integer to store the derivative level
    The member function(s) are:
        - derivative(): take the first derivative of the current polynomial by taking the derivative of 
                        each Term in the vector
        - toString(): return the whole polynomial as a string

2. A Term class for each of the terms in the polynomial
    The member(s) are:
        - a Fraction as the coefficient
        - a character as the variable
        - an integer as the exponent
        - an integer as the sign
    The member function(s) are:
        - multiply(): multiply the coefficient by a number (the number would be passed into the function)
        - derivative(): take the first derivative of the Term
        - toString(): return the Term as a string
        - toStringFirst(): return the Term as a string (for the first Terms in the polynomials)

3. Main function
    - Let user input the function
    - Read the data, check whether the polynomial is valid or not.
    - If valid, create a Polynomial, determine the number of Terms
    - Let user enter the derivative order
    - Calculate the derivative order
    - Display the result
