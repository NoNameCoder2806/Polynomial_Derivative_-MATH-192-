 --- A program to calculate the derivative based on the derivative order ---
1. A Polynomial class to store the whole polynomial function
    The member(s) are:
        - a character as the symbol of the function
        - a character as the symbol of the variable
        - a vector to store all the Terms
        - an integer to store the derivative level
    The member function(s) are:
        - addTerm(): add a Term to the Polynomial
        - derivative(): take the first derivative of the current polynomial by taking the derivative of 
                        each Term in the vector
        - toString(): return the whole polynomial as a string
        - sort(): sort the Terms in the Polynomial

2. A Term class for each of the terms in the polynomial
    The member(s) are:
        - a Fraction as the coefficient
        - a character as the variable
        - an integer as the exponent
        - an integer as the sign
    The member function(s) are:
        - multiply(): multiply the coefficient by a number (the number would be passed into the function)
        - derivative(): take the first derivative of the Term
        - toString(): return the Term as a string

3. Main function
    - Let user input the function
    - Read the data, check whether the polynomial is valid or not.
    - If valid, create a Polynomial, determine the number of Terms
    - Let user enter the derivative order
    - Calculate the derivative order
    - Display the result

4. Features:
    - Power rule application for polynomials
    - Allows multiple consecutive signs (Ex: f(x) = 2x^3 +--+- x^2)
    - Supports integer / interger fractions (Ex: f(x) = 2/34x^3 + 1/6x^2)
    - Supports decimal values (Ex: f(x) = 12.56x^8 + 23.1x)
    - Support constants as characters (Ex: f(x) = 2a/3x^4 + 0.125bcx^3)
    - Support variables that have multiple characters (Ex: f(xyz) = 2xyz^6 + 1)
    - 

5. Features to add:
    - Negative exponents
